# Recursive_BST
This project demonstrates the use of a recursive structured Binary Search Tree, in Java. Learning how to program this was a great time, and I have been encouraged to tackle it one more time in C++.
This project is on master, I forgot to push it to main instead of master, so to view it you must navigate to master.
